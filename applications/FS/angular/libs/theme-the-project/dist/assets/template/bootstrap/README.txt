How to Update Bootstrap Framework?

The Project is a static HTML template. You need to update the Bootstrap
framework manually. We highly recommend you check or watch the repository
https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases of the Bootstrap framework for
new releases, and update it on your website if there are new releases.

The Project - Multipurpose Website template is compatible with Bootstrap 4.x version.

In order to update the bootstrap framework you need to download the
latest 4.x version from its repository https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap
and replace the files of html/template/bootstrap folder in the template,
with the updated files.
